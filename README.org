* Why Emacs?

    I started using Emacs in 2010 and my relationship with it has been on and off. I mostly use Jetbrains IntelliJ IDEA
    for my work. But the idea of Emacs - everything inside is awesome. You can configure IDEA to an extent but after that
    it just gives up. Checking emails, managing schedule, and taking notes - few things that are lacking in IDEA. Emacs
    on the other hand is an Operating System in itself. You can configure it the way you want and for your comfort and
    there is a huge community to help, guide and support you.
